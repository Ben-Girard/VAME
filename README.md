# VAME in a Nutshell
VAME is a probabilistic machine learning framework for clustering of behavioral signals obtained from pose-estimation tools.
It is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) based deep learning framework which leverages the power of recurrent neural networks (RNN) to model sequential data. The workflow of VAME consists of 5 steps and we explain them in detail [here] (https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME/wiki/VAME-workflow).
